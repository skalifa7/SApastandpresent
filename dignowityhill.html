<h1><b>The colorful history of the once exclusive Dignowity Hill neighborhood</b></h1>
<br><br>
<p>Now considered a historic neighborhood, Dignowity Hill was first settled in the early 1850s by Czech immigrant Michael Dignowity with his wife Amanda.
      Dignowity, a physician, purchased 27 acres on San Antonio’s east side which was on a higher elevation that overlooked the city.  He sold estate 
      sized lots to wealthy merchants and businessmen and named his own estate “Harmony House.”  It was the first exclusive residential neighborhood in 
      San Antonio with its own water system.</p>
<p> Though he had a thriving practice, he became well known in the area for his controversial anti-slavery views.  In fact, Confederate sympathizers
     threatened to hang him in Alamo Plaza, so he fled San Antonio to Washington DC in 1861. Upon returning in 1869, he discovered most of his land 
     had been taken from him.  He passed away in 1875 and the hilltop where his home once stood, is now Dignowity City Park.</p> 
<p>The railroad arrived in 1877 and dramatically changed the neighborhood’s demographic and diversity while bringing much industrial development
    to the area.  By the turn of the century, an Iron Works factory was built, sewer and water lines were extended and there was a trolley line
     along Burnet Street.  By the 1930s many of the original homes were gone, including Harmony House.  After Harmony House was demolished, the
      property became Dignowity Park in 1926. Most of the houses in the neighborhood were Craftsman Bungalows and small Folk Victorian style houses.</p>
<p>Eventually the construction of the I-35 and I-37 divided the neighborhood from downtown and brought swift gentrification with it. In recent years, 
    many investors have moved into the neighborhood and are working to revive it.</p>
<p>My own connection to the neighborhood is my great grandparents owned a home on Nolan Street for several decades, just a couple of blocks away from
    Dignowty City Park, and would’ve seen the destruction of Harmony House.  My mom spent most of her childhood at her granny’s and often reminiced 
    of the beautiful Victorian style home with a wrap around porch.  After my great grandmother’s death in 1962, the home was demolished and a parking
     lot for a large warehouse is now in it’s place. </p>
