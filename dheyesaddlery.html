<h1><b>From Fine Saddles for the Rich and Famous to Dancing on Bar Tops</b></h1>
<br><br>
<p>In the heart of downtown San Antonio on East Commerce is a building that once housed D. Heye Saddlery which crafted some of the finest saddles around for more than a hundred years.</p>  
    <p>Born in 1837 in Holstein, Germany, Diedrich Heye came to San Antonio during the mid-1800s along with a large wave of German immigrants who settled in the region at the time.</p>
    <p>He had an apprenticeship in England after receiving his initial training in Germany. Next, he moved to Mexico City so he could learn the art of silver decorated saddles which was popular in American Western saddlery.</p> 
    <p>In 1866, he moved to San Antonio and set up shop on Commerce Street.  His shop quickly built up so much of a reputation for quality saddlery, some claimed they were identifiable from half a mile away because of their distinctive patterns and silver conchos.  Becoming very popular with the rich and famous, the shop even outfitted the likes of Teddy Roosevelt and the Rough Riders for their charge up San Juan Hill as well as Richard King, founder of the King Ranch.</p>
    <p>Diedrich Heye passed away in 1896, but the business carried on through his sons and other relatives into the 1970s.  As automobiles gradually began to replace horses for transportation, they expanded their inventory to include lots of different leather goods, including luxury luggage.</p>
    <p>Now the present home of Coyote Ugly Saloon, famous for its female bartenders dancing on the bar tops, the building still bears the original upper façade reading “D. Heye, Est. 1867.”</p>
    <p>I’m proud to say that Diedrich Heye is my great, great grandfather.  I began studying my genealogy around 5 years ago but didn't know about this building until one of my Heye cousins posted about it on Facebook about two years ago.  I really enjoy studying my family tree and highly encourage everyone to do the same. You never know when you will uncover fun things like this in your family’s history.
