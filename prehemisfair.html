<h1><b>The Neigborhood that was sacraficed for Hemisfair '68</b></h1> 
<br>
<br>

<p>Germantown was a thriving neighborhood just southeast of downtown San Antonio.  It was populated with a mixture of Polish, Mexican, German, 
    and African American immigrants all living side by side.  Most buildings and houses in the neighboorhood were constructed during the mid to 
    late 19th century.  There were many businesses, Rodfei Shalom Jewish Temple, St. Michael’s Catholic church and school, modest cottages, as well 
    as large Victorian style mansions comparable to anything in the King William district.  “It was a neighboorhood in need of some repair, but not
     an urban slum,” stated Hettie Mary Worley in he 1968 booklet, “Houses at Hemisfair Park.”  But it all went away in the mid 1960s when the city
      began making plans for the World’s Fair in 1968. </p>

<p>In the late 1950s, city leaders began working on plans for urban renewel so they could bring the World’s Fair to San Antonio.  The intention was 
    to expand San Antonio’s tourism industry.  Fair organizers settled on 93 acres of Germantown as the location to build Hemisfair.  More than 1600
     residents were displaced through eminant domain and more than 1300 buildings were demolished. There were even reports of some residents who'd
    been there for generations and refused to leave, literally being drug out of their homes so demolition could begin. Despite efforts by the 
    San Antonio Conservation Society to list 73 structures in the area as historically significant, only 22 survived.</p>

<p>Though the fair succeeded in boosting San Antonio’s tourism industry, attendance didn’t match what was expected and the city lost $7.5 million – 
    approximately $64 million by today’s standards.  Many of the structures on site sat largely unused for 50 years after the fair was over.  And now 
    the city has begun revitalizing the area yet again by adding a large park as well as plans to build  a 29 story mixed use tower on site with
     aproximately 320 residential units and about 55,000 square feet of retail space, as well as the possibility of a new arena for the Spurs. </p>
